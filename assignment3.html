        The gif above shows the circuit operation. As the photoresistor's light source is blocked,
        the red LED turns off and the green LED turns on. When the light source is unblocked, the 
        opposite happens: the green LED turns off and the red LED turns on.

As the Arduino provides 5V of power and LEDs typically want to run at 20mA, a resistor is necessary in the circuit so that the LEDs don't burn out. 
This circuit includes green and red LEDs, which both exhibit a 1.8 V drop. Using Ohm's Law (V=I*R) we can calculate the resistance necessary for 
the LEDs to not get burnt out by the circuit. 

V = I*R
5 V - 1.8 V = 20 mA * R
R = 3.2 V / 20 mA = 160 ohms

As 160 ohms is the minimum resistance necessary, I used a 330 ohm resistor for both LEDs so that they don't appear too bright.

For the photoresistor, the voltage divider may read values around 400 to 800, although it is dependent on the light source. In my circuit's operation, 
my photoresistor exhibited values from 0 to 1200. Another 10,000 ohm resistor was necessary as part of this circuit in order to prevent floating.
Floating occurs when it is difficult to read the current. By adding a larger resistor (10,000 ohms), the reading of the analog pin will be more accurate. 

V= I*R
5 V = 0.0005 A * R
R = 5 V / 0.0005 A = 10000 ohms
