            The gif above shows the circuit's operation. Each LED is meant to turn on for 
                two seconds, then off for two seconds, in the following order: 
                red led, blue led, white led.

                The image above shows the schematic for the following circuit. In this schematic, the resistors come before the LEDs.

As the Arduino provides 5V of power and LEDs typically want to run at 20mA, a resistor is necessary in the circuit so that the LEDs don't burn out. 
This circuit includes red, white, and blue LEDs. Red LEDs have a 1.8 V drop, while white and blue LEDs have a 3.3 V drop. Using Ohm's Law (V=I*R) 
we can calculate the resistance necessary for the LEDs to not get burnt out by the circuit. 

White/ Blue:
V = I*R
5 V - 3.3 V = 20 mA * R
R = 1.7 V / 20 mA = 85 ohms

Red:
V = I*R
5 V - 1.8 V = 20 mA * R
R = 3.2 V / 20 mA = 160 ohms

Based on these calculations, I originally used a 100 ohm resistor for the white and blue LEDs. However, this made the LEDs very bright, so I 
settled on a 1000 ohm resistor for both. For the red LED, I used a 330 ohm resistor.
