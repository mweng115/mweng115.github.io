            <h1>Assignment 5: High(er) voltage and transistors!</h1>
            <p>
            I had a bit of difficulty building this one, so this assignment is only going to show the schematic and firmware.
            Shout out to Mileena Ros who took this class before for helping me with the firmware.

        The image above shows the schematic. The LED is powered by 12 V, which is regulated by an N-MOSFET transistor connected to pin 9 of the Arduino. 
        The LED strip draws 1.5A of current, which is well below the transistor's maximum rating of 32A. A capacitive touch sensor is created by attaching
        a  piece of metal and 1M ohm resistor between pins 2 and 4. The 1M ohm resistance is a good value for detecting whether someone is physically touching
        the metal.
