            Here is all the documentation for assignment 2, including:

                The circuit operation shows three LEDs fading and brightening in unison. The LED operation can be turned on and off by holding the button.

                The image above shows the schematic for assignment 2. In the Schematic, the resistors come before the LEDs but the resistor for the button comes after.

As the Arduino provides 5V of power and LEDs typically want to run at 20mA, a resistor is necessary in the circuit so that the LEDs don't burn out. 
This circuit includes yellow, white, and blue LEDs. Yellow LEDs have a 1.8 V drop, while white and blue LEDs have a 3.3 V drop. Using Ohm's Law (V=I*R) 
we can calculate the resistance necessary for the LEDs to not get burnt out by the circuit. 

White/ Blue:
V = I*R
5 V - 3.3 V = 20 mA * R
R = 1.7 V / 20 mA = 85 ohms

Yellow:
V = I*R
5 V - 1.8 V = 20 mA * R
R = 3.2 V / 20 mA = 160 ohms

Based on these calculations, I originally used a 100 ohm resistor for the white and blue LEDs. However, this made the LEDs very bright, so I 
settled on a 1000 ohm resistor for both. For the yellow LED, I used a 330 ohm resistor. 

The button in this circuit also requires a resistor in order to limit the current. This is so that it is easier for the pin to read when the
button is on or off. Using Ohm's Law, we can calculate the resistance necessary to limit the current to 0.0005 A, a current value which will
limit floating without making it difficult to read when the current is flowing. Shout out to Shivank for helping with this explanation.

V= I*R
5 V = 0.0005 A * R
R = 5 V / 0.0005 A = 10000 ohms

void setup() {
  // initialize the pins used for the LEDs
    pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(6, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(5, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // checks to see if the button is being pressed or not
  int reading = digitalRead(2);
  // if the button is not pressed (allowing current through)
  if (reading == 1){
    // increases the brightness of the LED from 0 to 255
    for (int fadeValue = 0 ; fadeValue <= 255; fadeValue += 5) {
      analogWrite(9, fadeValue);
      analogWrite(6, fadeValue);
      analogWrite(5, fadeValue);
      // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the brightening effect
      delay(30);
    }
    // decreases the brightness of the LED from 255 to 0
    for (int fadeValue = 255 ; fadeValue >= 0; fadeValue -= 5) {
      analogWrite(9, fadeValue);
      analogWrite(6, fadeValue);
      analogWrite(5, fadeValue);
      // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
      delay(30);
    }
  // if the button is being pressed (not allowing current through)
  } else {
    // make the output of the pins connected to LEDs equal to zero, turning the LEDs off
    analogWrite(9, 0);
    analogWrite(6, 0);
    analogWrite(5, 0);
  }
