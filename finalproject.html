            <h1>Final Project</h1>
            <h2>Project Concept/Motivation</h2>
              <p>
I would like to make a led lego orchid that changes color when something is pressed, hopefully a capacitive sensor but a pushbutton if the capacitive sensor doesn’t work
Anticipated Bill of Materials: 
                <ul>
                <li>RGB LEDs</li>
<li>Lego Orchid Set</li>
                  <li>Resistors</li>
                  <li>Wires</li>
                  <li>pushbutton/ foil</li>
                  <li>Arduino</li>
            </ul>
              </p>
<h2>Timeline and contingency plans:</h2>
By March 2nd, build in circuit to physical prototype (try to make sure wires don’t show too much)
If anything goes wrong, finish by March 5th
By March 5th, finish firmware
If anything goes wrong, finish by March 7th and go to office hours
By March 7th, finish demo + video
If anything goes wrong, finish by March 9th
By March 8th, finish documentation
